          <h3>Freud’s Early Conception of Hate</h3>
          <p>
            In Freud’s early theory of instincts, love and hate were conceived
            of as nonidentical twins. Love aimed to acquire pleasure and
            pleasurable objects, and hate expelled the unpleasurable into the
            outside world. ‘The ego hates, abhors and pursues with intent to
            destroy all objects which are a source of unpleasurable feeling for
            it,’ wrote Freud, equating hate with destruction. After a partial
            reworking of his instinct theory in
            <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em> (1920), Freud incorporated
            love among the life instincts and placed hate in the service of the
            death instinct. At this point, therefore, hate had two potential
            functions: it could serve a mnemic purpose (‘to restore an earlier
            state of things’) if considered a facet of the death instinct, or it
            could fulfill a purely expulsive-destructive function if conceived
            according to the earlier instinct theory.

          <h3>Destructive Hate in Object-Relations Theory</h3>
          <p>
            Psychoanalytic theory is not shy of references to destructive hate.
            Indeed, if we consider hate in object-relations theory, we assume a
            complex process whereby an internal object is damaged or destroyed
            and the ego is faced with the exceedingly daunting task of
            renegotiating internal reality in the wake of such hate. An internal
            object that is damaged by hate may lead to phobic withdrawal from
            the external representations of the object, or it may lead to an
            addictively depressive state that is a compromise formation between
            the wish to damage the object further and the dread of being
            attacked from within for such destructiveness. If the internal
            object is psychologically destroyed, it may be expelled into
            fragmented objects which assume a bizarre quality.

          <h3>Nondestructive Hate and the Idea of “Loving Hate”</h3>
          <p>
            When a person hates, is it always true to say that he wishes to
            destroy? I am sure that most clinicians can find an exception to the
            rule of destructive hate in their clinical work, and I will examine
            certain nondestructive forms of hate. It is my view that in some
            cases a person hates an object not in order to destroy it, but to do
            precisely the opposite: to conserve the object. Such hate is
            fundamentally nondestructive in intent and, although it may have
            destructive consequences, its aim may be to act out an unconscious
            form of love. I am inclined to term this “loving hate,” by which I
            mean a situation where an individual preserves a relationship by
            sustaining a passionate negative cathexis of it. If the person
            cannot do so by hating the object, he may accomplish this passionate
            cathexis by being hateful and inspiring the Other to hate him. A
            state of reciprocal hate may prevail, but in the persons whom I
            shall be describing, such hate is singular, not genuinely mutual.
          </p>
          <p>
            The subject finds that only through hating or being hateful can he
            compel an object into passionate relating. Therefore, although two
            people in such circumstances may seem to have accomplished a
            reciprocity of hate, it is illusory, as the object is never assumed
            to be capable of genuine mutual action: even one of hating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viewed this way, hate is not the opposite of but a substitute for
            love. A person who hates with loving passion does not dread
            retaliation by the object; on the contrary, he welcomes it. What he
            does live in fear of is indifference, of not being noticed or seen
            by the Other. Passionate hate is generated as an alternative to
            love, which is assumed to be unavailable.

          <h3>Winnicott and the Positive Function of Hate</h3>
          <p>
            The literature on the positive function of hate, or fundamentally
            nondestructive hate, is sparse. In Europe, Winnicott was one of the
            first analysts to emphasize its positive functions. In an early
            paper on aggression, he argues that “aggression is part of the
            primitive expression of love”; he further stresses that, in the
            course of his ruthlessness, an infant “does not appreciate the fact
            that what he destroys when excited is the same as that which he
            values in quiet intervals between excitements. His excited love
            includes an imaginative attack on the mother’s body. Here is
            aggression as a part of love.” Winnicott always saw aggression as a
            positive factor in human growth, frequently equating it with
            motility, and he would never have made it equivalent to hate. But in
            his work on the transitional object, he makes it possible for us to
            imagine a form of hate which is positive; that intensely
            concentrated, aggressive use of a transitional object, which is
            founded on the infant’s knowledge and gratitude that the object will
            survive. The infant needs the object of his hate to survive attacks
            against it, and this object, which is itself the trace of the
            mother’s capacity to survive the infant’s attack, is carefully and
            jealously guarded by the infant against true destruction (against
            loss or actual change of state). Winnicott realized that each child
            needs to hate a safe object, since in so doing he can see the total
            experience of a certain kind of hate through to its completion. In
            attacking the object, the infant brings to bear, in reality, a self
            state which up to that point has been primarily internal, and as the
            object allows for this misuse of it, its capacity to survive is
            appreciated by the infant, who needs to externalize and to actualize
            his hate.

          <h3>Fairbairn’s View of the Schizoid Individual</h3>
          <p>
            In 1940 Fairbairn wrote a profoundly insightful paper about the
            schizoid individual who, because of his early experiences as an
            infant in relation to a particular kind of mother, regarded his love
            as destructive. Some schizoid defenses therefore aimed to isolate
            the individual from Others; more significantly, they were developed
            to prevent the schizoid person from either loving or being loved.
            Such an individual “may quarrel with people, be objectionable, be
            rude. In so doing, he not only substitutes hate for love in his
            relationships with his objects, but also induces them to hate,
            instead of loving him.” By using hate in this manner, the schizoid
            acts in a curiously “moral” manner. According to Fairbairn, “the
            moral motive is determined by the consideration that, if loving
            involves destroying, it is better to destroy by hate, which is
            overtly destructive and bad, than to destroy by love, which is by
            rights creative and good.”

        <section>
          <h3>Later Psychoanalytic Contributions</h3>
          <p>
            Balint (1951) regarded hate as a defense against primitive object
            love and archaic dependence, and Searles (1956) argued that
            vengefulness was both a defense against repressed grief and a covert
            means of maintaining an object tie. Pao (1965) said that one of the
            “ego syntonic uses of hatred” is that it allows the person to feel
            something, so that eventually “hatred may become an essential
            element from which one derives a sense of self-sameness and upon
            which one formulates one’s identity.” Stolorow (1972) added that
            there are certain patients who use hate as a defense against the
            “possibility of forgiveness” because to forgive would be to
            destabilize the person’s object world, one presumably constructed
            through hate.

          <h3>Hate as a Companion to Love</h3>
          <p>
            Other analysts indicate in their work a sophisticated understanding
            of the ways in which hate serves specific, and potentially positive,
            functions of the self. But I do not want to review the literature, I
            am only suggesting the outline of a tradition of looking at hate in
            a different way: associating hate more closely with love rather than
            assuming it to be the direct opposite.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no one particular family idiom that sponsors a loving hate.
            I do not claim that the pathological family situations that I shall
            discuss are the only pathways to loving hate: I am sure there are
            many. Furthermore, it is worth bearing in mind that a discussion of
            pathology often precludes consideration of more “ordinary” forms of
            a phenomenon. In the natural course of affairs, children hate their
            parents with a passion, lasting a few minutes or even hours, and
            this hate aims to conserve the parental object, not to destroy it,
            so that the child can have the full course of pleasure in hating.
            There is an ordinary need to hate the loved object, one essential to
            the child’s cumulative expression of self states that further
            enables him to feel a sense of personal reality in his lived life.

        <h3>Key Takeaways on Lovinghate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Freud:</strong> Hate was seen as destructive, expelling what
            is unpleasurable from the ego.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Object-relations theory:</strong> Hate can involve complex
            dynamics with internal and external objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nondestructive hate:</strong> In some cases, hate is not
            aimed at destruction but at forcing passionate engagement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hate as substitute for love:</strong> Sometimes hatred
            maintains connection when love feels unavailable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Positive functions:</strong> Analysts like Winnicott
            highlighted hate as a natural and even healthy part of development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fairbairn’s schizoid insight:</strong> Hate can help the
            isolated self reach toward relationships.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Later views:</strong> Balint, Searles, and others explored
            hate as defense, grief expression, or a creative force.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Everyday relevance:</strong> “Loving hate” appears in
            ordinary family and social life, not just pathology.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In short, hate is not always the destructive opposite of love. It can
          serve as a bridge to connection, passion, and even growth — when it
          does not collapse into pure hostility.
